# Hello-World
First Time Flying in space throwing damaging water physics at each other like super saying smash broham
I want to  kamehameha a space staion ond blow chunks out of planets.... possibly decimate some cities but mostly i think ive got a pretty cool idea about how to balance power levels in an open world dbz game without forcing a level cap .
also ive never coded anything beyond some basic html. so. yay for me.
im using unreal 4. just poking around wit some ps4 vR and taking a shot at 3d modeling i guess
